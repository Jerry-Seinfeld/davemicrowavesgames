            <h2>Strange Terror From The Deep:</h2>
            <p>You survived the terrors of space, it took a few years to recover from that experience<br> and now you're
              back on your
              feet, ready to get back to work.<br> However, your luck just can't get any worse.<br> The creature you
              were transporting on your
              submersible has broken free from captivity<br> and killed off most of your crew. All that's left is you,
              Alice, Dr. Salmon,
              Commander Nathan<br> and The Captain. Now only one question remains.<br> Are you a bad enough dude to
              escape the terrors from
              the deep?<br>

              Explore a large and all new derelict submersible, featuring 9 endings, a bunch of gadgets, tools,<br>
              objectives and 25
              brand new monsters, each with their own special abilities, strengths and weaknesses!<br> Featuring special
              guest monsters
              such as, Baldi (legally added in and approved by Basicly Games LLC),<br> an old friend from Strange Terror
              From Beyond The
              Stars, Nosferatu and more!<br> And if you ever feel like the terrors that lurk in the deep are too easy to
              handle,<br> then get
              ready for all new modes such as Hardcore Mode, a challenge only veterans can accomplish,<br> Monochrome
              Mode, a throwback to
              the original and Custom Mode, select whichever monster you wish to go up against!</p>

            <h2>Strange Terror From Beyond The Stars:</h2>
            <p>There were twenty crew members at the beginning of the galactic expedition of 1967,<br> but only five
              remain in the
              aftermath of the strange terror...<br>

              Witness a truely horrifying sci-fi game, with a 60s aesthetic.<br> Each time you play, you'll go up against
              one of
              seventeen monsters,<br>each with their own special abilities. Including special guests from iconic movies
              and random
              monstrosities!<br>

              This game was directed by none other than Dave Microwaves Games!<br>
              Featuring voice actors
              such as JayskiBean,<br> who plays the brave soul who is desperately trying to escape the ship.<br>
              NathanBlakeGames, who plays
              the pilot, warning the player of impending doom.<br> And TheGameSalmon, who plays the role of the General
              Maintenance
              Worker stuck in a closet...<br>
